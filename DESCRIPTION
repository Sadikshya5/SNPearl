Description: SNPearl is an R package designed for performing Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) using Generalized Linear Models (GLM) while integrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to correct for population structure. It provides a streamlined pipeline to analyze genetic association between phenotypic traits and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPearl ensures robustness by automatically excluding highly correlated principal components with user-supplied covariates, reducing confounding effects. The package outputs association statistics, including p-values, and provides visualization tools such as Manhattan and Q-Q plots for result interpretation. Additionally, SNPearl includes a simulation framework to compare its performance against other GWAS methods, demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy.
